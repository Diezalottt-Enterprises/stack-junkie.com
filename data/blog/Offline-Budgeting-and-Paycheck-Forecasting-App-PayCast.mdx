# PayCast v0.3.1-alpha: We're in Closed Testing!

## Quick Summary

PayCast v0.3.1-alpha enters closed testing: a privacy-first budgeting and paycheck forecasting app, built publicly with AI assistance.

---

## Introduction

Remember when I launched the [$1.00 Challenge](/blog/introducing-the-dollar-challenge) three weeks ago and said I'd document everything? Well, today marks a huge milestone: PayCast, my paycheck forecasting and budget planner app, just hit closed alpha testing at v0.3.1!

If you've been following my journey, you know I've had my share of [AI coding disasters](/blog/i-became-enemies-with-kilo) (looking at you, Kilo Code). But through all the deleted files, scope creep, and "why-won't-this-API-work" moments, PayCast has emerged from the ashes.

I've had many ideas. And began development on many of them. Then scrapped them. I was struggling to get anything finished or even to the MVP stage. So instead of pursuing one of my many more complex challenges, I decided to actually finish the budgeting app I've always wanted. This is all very exciting for me. And honestly? It's starting to look like a real app.

## Main Content

### What is PayCast?

PayCast is my answer to the budgeting apps that feel like they were designed by accountants for accountants. You know the ones—where adding a transaction takes seventeen taps and syncing your bank requires a PhD in fintech. Creating categories for income or expense was like pulling teeth. And the permissions some of these required were wild!

I wanted something different:

- **Mobile-first design** - Swipe through budget items with intuitive card, grid, or calendar views
- **Paycheck forecasting** - Not just tracking spending, but predicting future financial scenarios
- **100% offline & private** - Your financial data stays on YOUR device, no servers, no tracking
- **Smart categorization** - Color-coded, organized budget items you can actually find
- **No judgment zone** - We all have that subscription we forgot to cancel

### The Journey to v0.3.1-alpha

#### PayCast MVP

Following my own [MVP definition guide](/blog/how-to-define-your-software-mvp-from-a-prd-step-by-step-guide), I ruthlessly cut features. Remember that MoSCoW method? Here's what made the cut:

**Must Haves (All implemented before v0.3.1)**

- Smart budget management with income/expense tracking
- Multiple view modes (card, grid, calendar) optimized for mobile
- Paycheck forecasting to predict future scenarios
- Recurring transaction support (monthly, bi-weekly, weekly, daily)
- Data export/import with backup functionality
- 100% offline functionality - no internet required

**Should Haves (Coming in beta)**

- PWA installation prompts
- Enhanced forecasting algorithms
- Budget templates for common scenarios
- Monthly spending analytics

**Could Haves (On the roadmap)**

- Budget sharing for couples/families
- Bill reminder notifications
- Savings goal tracking with visual progress
- Desktop companion app

After many more hours of grinding...

#### PayCast Current Build

##### Smart Budget Management

- **Monthly Budget Tracking**: Create and manage detailed monthly budgets with income and expense tracking
- **Multiple View Modes**: Switch between mobile-optimized card view, grid view, and calendar view
- **Smart Categorization**: Organize budget items by categories (Salary, Rent, Groceries, Entertainment, etc.)
- **Visual Organization**: Color-coded budget items for quick identification
- **Recurring Transactions**: Set frequency for recurring items (Monthly, Bi-Weekly, Weekly, Daily, One-Time)
- **Auto-Calculations**: Real-time calculation of monthly totals and budget summaries

##### Advanced Financial Tools

- **Paycheck Forecasting**: Predict future financial scenarios and plan ahead
- **Month-by-Month Navigation**: Seamlessly move between different budget periods
- **Data Export/Import**:
  - Backup your complete budget data
  - Export monthly data for external analysis
  - Restore from previous backups
- **Offline-First**: All data stored securely on your device - no internet required

### Technical Stack & Lessons Learned

After my many adventures utilizing [AI-assisted development](blog/introducing-the-dollar-challenge), I've settled on this tech stack:

- React 18 & Zustand – Fast, responsive UI with reliable state management
- Capacitor – Single codebase for native-feeling Android & iOS builds
- TailwindCSS + DaisyUI – Ready-made, accessible components and utility-first styling
- Vite – Lightning-fast dev server and instant hot-reloads
- Service Workers (PWA) – Offline caching and “install on home screen” prompts

The biggest lesson? Choose popular, well-documented technology. Every time I tried to do something unique with some obscure framework, I'd hit a wall where even AI couldn't help because there wasn't enough training data. Stick with what has a massive community and documentation.

### Current State of the Alpha

Here's the honest truth about v0.3.1-alpha:

**What's Working:**

- Core budget management with multiple view modes is smooth
- Paycheck forecasting gives real insights into future finances
- Offline-first approach means zero server issues or data sync problems
- Monthly navigation and recurring transactions work flawlessly
- Data export/import for easy backups

**What's Still Rough:**

- PWA install prompts need refinement
- Some edge cases with complex recurring patterns
- The onboarding could use more hand-holding
- Calendar view performance with 50+ items needs optimization

### Who's in the Closed Testing Group?

As of this morning, there are 5 brave souls testing PayCast! A few more have started by the time this posts. But here's the thing: I need 12 testers for 14 days to meet the app store requirements for production release.

Current testers include:

- Some folks from Reddit's r/AndroidClosedTesting
- Fellow build-in-public community members
- A couple of friends who've endured my "I'm building an app" rants

## Future Features in the Pipeline

Based on tester feedback and my own vision for PayCast, here's what's coming:

**Near-term (Beta Release)**

- Enhanced forecasting with "what-if" scenarios
- Budget templates (Student, Family, Freelancer presets)
- Improved onboarding with interactive tutorials
- Performance optimizations for large budgets

**Medium-term (v1.0)**

- Desktop companion app for power users
- Advanced analytics and spending insights
- Multi-currency support

**Long-term Vision**

- Family budget sharing (still keeping it local-first)
- Financial goal tracking and recommendations

The future will also have an opt-in for folks who want to have cloud backups and other services that would go beyond the simple budget app functionality. These features would be services that will be provided, and the only stuff behind a cheap paywall to cover costs. This is tied to my original goal to [make a dollar](blog/introducing-the-dollar-challenge) The official strategy is to be defined.

## Conclusion

PayCast v0.3.1-alpha isn't perfect. It's not even close. But it works, real people are using it.

This closed testing phase is teaching me more about building software than two years of tutorials ever could. Every bug fix is a lesson. Every confused user is highlighting a UX failure I was blind to. Every "this would be cool if..." that I hear tells me that people actually care enough to imagine a future with PayCast.

### Next Steps

1. **Iterate based on tester feedback**
2. **Prepare for public beta**
3. **Start the monetization experiment** - Remember the $1.00 Challenge? Time to test pricing
